TvSeries Progress Tracker - Chrome Extension

With this chrome extension you can track your progress in all your tv series and reach all your favourites websites (for subs and streaming) in a matter of a few clicks.

It was developed entirely by me as a summer experiment and as an excuse to learn some javascript e some patterns.
I initially built it in some crappy javascript way, but decided to convert it when learnt about module pattern and revealing module pattern (which I really liked).

Hope it could be useful to anyone (both as a javascript chrome extension example or as an actual tracker of your progress in tv series).
